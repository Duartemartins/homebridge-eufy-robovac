# Get Device ID & Local Key

There are multiple ways to get the `deviceId`/`localKey`, but here are the steps which worked for me:

1. Install [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/). 
1. Install [ADB](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17901692/set-up-adb-on-mac-os-x) (this requires HomeBrew on macOS).
1. Install [EufyHome 2.3.2](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/anker/eufyhome/eufyhome-2-3-2-release/eufyhome-2-3-2-android-apk-download/) in the emulator (double click the app and it should auto install).
1. Follow the [instructions to log the data](https://github.com/joshstrange/eufy-robovac).
